# Ballistic Trajectory Simulator

A Python-based project that simulates a bullet's flight trajectory using atmospheric conditions, drag physics, and ballistic parameters. Includes dynamic angle optimization to hit a target and fine-grained tracking with millimeter precision.

## Features

- Simulation of bullet motion considering:
  - G7 drag model
  - Wind components
  - Gravity
- Computes firing angle and azimuth correction to hit target elevation and lateral position
- Calculates air density from temperature, pressure, and humidity
- Drag coefficient interpolated using Mach number
- Precise interpolation at target and optional 100â€¯m mark
- Exports results to CSV and PNG

## Physics Foundation

The simulator models motion using the following physical principles:

- **Drag Force (Fd):**  
  $$F_d = \frac{1}{2} C_d \cdot \rho \cdot A \cdot v^2$$  
  Drag coefficient \(C_d\) is interpolated from the G7 ballistic standard based on the Mach number.

- **Air Density:**  
  Computed using components of the ideal gas law:
  - Dry air: 
  $$\rho = P / (R_d \cdot T)$$
  - Water vapor:
  $$\rho = P_v / (R_v \cdot T)$$

- **Wind Effects:**  
  Wind is decomposed into horizontal and lateral components based on its angle relative to the shooter-target line (X-axis). A crosswind induces sideways drift of the bullet.

- **Firing Azimuth Correction:**  
  To compensate for lateral drift caused by crosswinds, the simulator dynamically adjusts the firing azimuth â€” the horizontal angle of the shot relative to the direct shooter-to-target axis (X-axis).  
  This correction ensures the bullet lands centered on the target despite wind.  
  It is computed automatically after the elevation angle is found.

## Limitations

Although the model aims for realism, please note the following simplifications:

- Euler integration â€” not ideal for long-range precision
- G7 drag data is limited â€” results may vary at extreme speeds
- Humidity influence on sound speed approximated
- No terrain elevation, spin drift, Coriolis force, or projectile deformation
- Assumes static, uniform wind

## Requirements

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

---

##  Usage

Run the simulator:

```bash
python bullet_simulator.py
```

---

## Input Parameters

The program prompts the user to enter the following ballistic and environmental values:

- `mass_grain` â€” Bullet mass in grains
- `velocity` â€” Muzzle velocity in meters per second (m/s)
- `distance_to_target` â€” Horizontal range to the target (m)
- `target_height` â€” Vertical elevation of the target (m)
- `temp_c` â€” Ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (Â°C)
- `pressure_hpa` â€” Atmospheric pressure in hectopascals (hPa)
- `humidity` â€” Relative humidity in percentage (%)

Optional values (depending on implementation):

- `wind_speed` â€” Wind velocity (m/s)
- `wind_angle` â€” Wind direction

## ðŸ“¤ Output Results

After simulation and calculations, the following results are generated:

- `Firing Angle` â€” Calculated in radians and degrees, printed to console
- `Azimuth Correction` â€”  Horizontal angle correction relative to shooter-target line, compensating wind drift
- `Interpolated Impact Point` â€” Coordinates at distance_to_target
- `Optional 100â€¯m Interpolation` â€” Bullet position at 100â€¯m if applicable
- `trajectory.csv` â€” CSV file with timestamped kinematic data:
  - Time [s], X [m], Y [m], Z [m], Velocity [m/s], Energy [J]
- `trajectory.png` â€” Visualization of vertical profile, lateral drift, and velocity/energy
