# Ballistic Trajectory Simulator

A Python-based project that simulates a bullet's flight trajectory using atmospheric conditions, drag physics, and ballistic parameters. Includes dynamic angle optimization to hit a target and fine-grained tracking with millimeter precision.

## Features

- Simulation of bullet motion considering:
  - G7 drag model
  - Wind components
  - Gravity
  - Coriolis force
- Computes firing angle and azimuth to hit target elevation and distance
- Calculates air density from temperature, pressure, and humidity
- Drag coefficient interpolated using Mach number
- Precise interpolation at target and optional 100â€¯m mark
- Exports results to CSV and PNG

## Physics Foundation

The simulator models motion using the following physical principles:

- **Drag Force (Fd):**  
  $$F_d = \frac{1}{2} C_d \cdot \rho \cdot A \cdot v^2$$  
  Drag coefficient \(C_d\) is interpolated from the G7 ballistic standard based on the Mach number.

- **Coriolis Effect:**  
  $$a_c = 2 \cdot \omega \cdot v \cdot \sin(\phi)$$  
  Introduces lateral drift (Y-axis) caused by Earthâ€™s rotation. Depends on latitude and absolute firing azimuth (geographic).

- **Air Density:**  
  Computed using components of the ideal gas law:
  - Dry air: 
  $$\rho = P / (R_d \cdot T)$$
  - Water vapor:
  $$\rho = P_v / (R_v \cdot T)$$

- **Wind Effects:**  
  Wind is decomposed into horizontal and lateral components based on its angle. A crosswind induces sideways drift of the bullet.

- **Firing Azimuth Correction:**  
  To compensate for lateral drift at the target distance, the simulator dynamically adjusts the firing azimuth â€” the horizontal angle of the shot relative to the direct shooter-to-target line.  
  This correction ensures the bullet lands at the center of the target despite crosswinds or Coriolis deviations.  
  It is computed automatically after the elevation angle is found and combined with the geographic azimuth to define the full shot direction.

## Limitations

Although the model aims for realism, please note the following simplifications:

- Euler integration â€” not ideal for long-range precision
- G7 drag data is limited â€” results may vary at extreme speeds
- Coriolis force simplified â€” assumes constant vector per timestep
- Humidity influence on sound speed approximated
- No terrain elevation, spin drift, or projectile deformation
- Assumes static, uniform wind

## Requirements

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

## Input Parameters

The program prompts the user to enter the following ballistic and environmental values:

- `mass_grain` â€” Bullet mass in grains
- `velocity` â€” Muzzle velocity in meters per second (m/s)
- `distance_to_target` â€” Horizontal range to the target (m)
- `target_height` â€” Vertical elevation of the target (m)
- `temp_c` â€” Ambient temperature in degrees Celsius (Â°C)
- `pressure_hpa` â€” Atmospheric pressure in hectopascals (hPa)
- `humidity` â€” Relative humidity in percentage (%)

Optional values (depending on implementation):

- `wind_speed` â€” Wind velocity (m/s)
- `wind_angle` â€” Wind direction

## ðŸ“¤ Output Results

After simulation and calculations, the following results are generated:

- `Firing Angle` â€” Calculated in radians and degrees, printed to console
- `Interpolated Impact Point` â€” Coordinates at distance_to_target
- `Optional 100â€¯m Interpolation` â€” Bullet position at 100â€¯m if applicable
- `trajectory.csv` â€” CSV file with timestamped kinematic data:
  - Time [s], X [m], Y [m], Z [m], Velocity [m/s], Energy [J]
- `trajectory.png` â€” Visualization of vertical profile, lateral drift, and velocity/energy
